    <p id="About-paragraph" class="about-page-text">Meagan is an artist based out of Montréal, Canada. She has garnered
        attention for her fan art of media that interests her, which has led to creators reaching out 
        and commissioning her or involving her in projects. She is currently conceptualizing a graphic
        novel while finishing her last year of graduate studies at McGill University in Information
        Studies. She has a deep interest in how digital art is shared and consumed online, and how
        this ephemeral art is documented and archived for future access. <br> <br>
        Working primarily in digital media, Meagan uses Procreate and Photoshop to create her art. She 
        applies intensive training from her undergraduate studies at Alberta University of the Arts,
        where she majored in Character Design and Illustration, to iterate and conceptualize projects 
        thoughtfully. Though she has taken a more academic route in recent years, she continues to create art in her 
        personal time and is always open to new collaborations and commissions. Meagan is looking forward 
        to seeing where the journey takes her. <br> <br>
